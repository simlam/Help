1. Run your sine program and compute the following values.
  a) x = 3.1415, n = 1

  b) x = 3.1415, n = 7

  c) x = 1.5707, n = 1

  d) x = 1.5707, n = 5

  e) x = 0, n = 10

2. Try to compute a sine value using a "large" value for n, say n = 100. What value do you get? Why do you think that is?

3. Play the guessing game at least 3 times to ensure that your program works. What is your best score (that is, least number of guesses)?
