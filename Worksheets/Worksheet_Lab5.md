Lab 5.0 Worksheet
Name(s) and Login(s):

1. Identify three functions you've used prior to this lab and identify the return type, the function identifier (name) and its parameter types.
For example, the math library's pow function has the following characteristics:

  Return Type: double
  Function Name: pow
  Parameter Type(s): (double, double)


2. Open all the files and review the code to answer the following questions.

  a) Identify all of the user-defined functions in the program along with the functions' return types and the number of parameters they accept.

  b) Among the functions main, strToIntArray, insertionSort, and getOrderStatistic: identify which function calls which other function(s).

  c) How might you implement the following function? Hint: it should only be a one-liner.

      int getMin(int *arr, n) {

      }

  d) Prototypes and documentation were placed in the header file and function definitions were placed into a separate source file. Identify at least one advantage of this approach.

  Demonstrate your final color utility program and testing file to a lab instructor, have them sign this worksheet and turn it in.
